				<h2>Mercedes-Benz : SUVs</h2>
				<hr width="50%">
				<h3>GLA</h3>
				<p>The Mercedes-Benz GLA-Class is a subcompact luxury crossover SUV manufactured and marketed by Mercedes-Benz over two generations. It is essentially the SUV equivalent of the A-Class, and the smallest SUV marketed by the brand. The production version was revealed in August 2013 ahead of the 2013 Frankfurt Auto Show in September 2013.</p>
				<p>The GLA-Class is powered by a range of petrol and diesel 4-cylinder engines, and comes in either front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive, the latter marketed by Mercedes as 4MATIC.</p>
				<p>The GLA nameplate aligns with Mercedes SUV nomenclature, where GL stands for Geländewagen (German for off-road vehicle) and the A designates its overall place in the Mercedes range, in this class, the smallest or A-Class.</p>
				<hr width="50%">
				<h3>GLC</h3>
				<p>The Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class (X253/C253) is a compact luxury crossover SUV introduced in 2015 for the 2016 model year that replaces the GLK-Class. According to Mercedes-Benz, it is the SUV equivalent to the C-Class.</p>
				<p>Under the vehicle naming scheme maintained by Mercedes-Benz, SUVs use the base name "GL", followed by the model's placement in Mercedes-Benz hierarchy. The "G" is for Geländewagen (German for off-road vehicle) and alludes to the long-running G-Wagen. This is followed by the letter "L" that acts as a linkage with the letter "C" to signify that the vehicle is a SUV equivalent to the C-Class.</p>
				<hr width="50%">
				<h3>GLE</h3>
				<p>The Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class, formerly Mercedes-Benz M-Class, is a mid-size luxury SUV produced by the German automaker Mercedes-Benz since 1997. In terms of size, it is slotted in between the smaller GLC-Class (based on the C-Class) and the larger GLS-Class, the latter with which it shares platforms.</p>
				<p>For a short time, between 1999 and 2002, the M-Class was also built by Magna Steyr in Graz, Austria, for the European market, before all production moved to the U.S. plant near Vance, Alabama. From late 2012, the M-Class was also assembled at new plants in India, Indonesia, and Thailand.</p>
