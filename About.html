				<h2>About Mercedes-Benz</h2>

				<p>As sustainability is the guiding principle of the Mercedes-Benz strategy and for the company itself, this means creating lasting value for all stakeholders: for customers, employees, investors, business partners and society as a whole. The basis for this is Daimler’s sustainable business strategy. The company thus takes responsibility for the economic, ecological and social effects of its business activities and looks at the entire value chain.</p>

				<h3>Mercedes-Benz Cars</h3>

With Mercedes-EQ, Mercedes-Benz Cars is driving forward the systematic development of alternative drives: the aim is to electrify the entire portfolio by 2022. The company will offer a range of electrified models in each segment, including 48-volt models, a wide choice of plug-in hybrids, and all-electric vehicles with battery. In this way, the Cars division of Mercedes-Benz AG ensures individual mobility for a vast spectrum of customer needs. The company aims to build the world’s most desirable cars.</p>

				<h3>Our strategy</h3>
				<br>
				<b>Our goal: to build the world’s most desirable cars:</b>
				<p>The Mercedes-Benz strategy is made up of six pillars. At its heart is the transformation of the company to become the number 1 for electric mobility and all-encompassing digitalisation. At the same time, there is a clear focus on the structural improvement of profitability, with sustainability as a guiding principle. The basis for the success of our new strategy is provided by our highly qualified and motivated team.</p>
				<b>Ambition 2039: the road to CO₂-neutrality.</b>
				<p>Under the heading “Ambition 2039”, Mercedes-Benz Cars has set itself ambitious yet realistic goals. As part of this, the automotive manufacturer is examining the issue of sustainability along the entire value chain. The goal is the transformation of the full range of passenger cars into a carbon-neutral product range as of 2039. This includes – from socially and climate-friendly degraded raw materials, through the supply chain, and the production of the vehicles – all stages up to the use phase as well as recycling concepts. Already during the development of a new model, Mercedes-Benz Cars looks at its environmental performance over the entire life cycle. Vehicles from Mercedes-Benz Cars are scrutinised in a comprehensive life-cycle assessment, the so-called 360-degree environmental check: from manufacture of the raw materials to production and from vehicle operation to recycling at the end of the vehicle’s service life – a long way off in the case of a new Mercedes-Benz.</p>
